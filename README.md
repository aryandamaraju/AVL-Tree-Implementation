# AVL-Tree-Implementation
Utilized an AVL tree data structure to efficiently maintain a self-balancing collection of data for fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. Performed insertion and deletion of dynamically allocated nodes using recursive functions. Wrote test file for efficiency and other cases.
